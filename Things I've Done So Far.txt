Add struct GGGGC_FreeObject to gc.h
Add a free list to GGGGC_POOL in gc.h

Made it so allocate sort of actaully allocates, currently it just checks if the current pool has enough free space
if it does then it allocates it at the end (so no checking free objects since those dont exist yet lol) and it also
doesn't iterate through the pool list at all just creates a new pool if the curPool doesn't have enough space.
